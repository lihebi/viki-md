in every step i, say we add u_i to the circle, which is added just after v_i.
Denote the original circle by ... v_i v_{i+1} ...
Now, we change the circle to ... v_i u_i v_{i+1} ...
note that e(vi,ui)+e(vi,vi+1)>e(ui,vi+1)
we have e(vi,ui)+e(ui,vi+1)<e(vi,vi+1)+2e(vi,ui)
that is, we have added less than 2e(vi,ui) in this step.
Let's denote the total for n step is c(T)<=2\sum_{c(vi,ui)}.
Note that in prim's algorithm, nodes and edges are added in exact the same sequence as closet-point heuristic.
We have \sum{c(vi,ui)}<= c(MST)<=c(OPT)
Thus we have c(T)<=2c(OPT).
