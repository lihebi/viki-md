## Problem

No Indexing method suited to **data objects of non-zero size located in multi-dimensional spaces**.

## Contributions

* Describe a dynamic index structure called R-Tree to meet the problem.
* Give algorithms for searching and updating it.
* Implementation and Performance.

## Comments

In CondenseTree algorithm, when a node has fewer than `m` entries,
delete the node and add **ALL Entries of N** to `Q`.
Then In the end, reinsert all in Q, which must be costy.
